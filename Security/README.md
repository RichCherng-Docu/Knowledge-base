## Metric/ Round-robin / IP Based Routing
- Routing poisoning: prevent a router from sending packets through a route that has become invalid.

## DNS caching
- DNS cache poisoning (DNS spoofing): traffic could be diverted from its normal destination

## ping
- Ping of death: A type of attack on a computer that invovles sending a malformed or otherwise malicious ping to a network device
- Ping flooding: Simply floods the system with so much ping traffic that normal traffic fails to reach the system
- Smurf attack: An attack in which large numbers of Interet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) pakcets with the intended victim's spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP Broadcast address

## SELINUX

## Man-in-the-middle attack
- an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

## ARP Spoofing
- ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attackerâ€™s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network.
